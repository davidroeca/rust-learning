## Compression Algorithm Implementation

The goal of this project is to learn about compression algorithms and at the same time learn how to effectively implement data structures in Rust. While I am aware that a [binary heap structure exists in Rust](http://doc.rust-lang.org/collections/binary_heap/index.html), I haven't implemented any data structures in rust yet and look at this as a good learning experience. As a compression algorithm novice, the current plan is to implement a [Huffman Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) compression algorithm.  

### Steps

1. Implement a heap data structure
  * Instantiation
  * Heapify
  * Insert
  * Extract
* Use the heap data structure as the implementor of a priority queue
* Implement the algorithm using the priority queue
